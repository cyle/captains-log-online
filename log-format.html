<h1>Captain's Log Format</h1>

<p><a href="./">&laquo; back to today's log</a></p>

<h2>Activities List Format</h2>

<p>For every discreet activity you perform, start a new line!</p>

<p>For each of those activities, each on a separate single line, you can include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you put a dash (-) and then a space at the start of the line, the parser will ignore it. It just makes the list easier for you to read, so feel free to use it.</li>
<li>The time spent doing the thing, in brackets, for time tracking. Examples: [1 hour] or [1h30m] or [9:00am - 1:00pm] or [9am to 11am]. All of those are valid and will be parsed.</li>
<li>A Footprints Help Desk ticket ID or RFC ID (from the Change Management workspace) associated with it, enclosed in curly braces. Regular old Help Desk tickets can look like this: {#27654} or {27654}, but RFCs you need to prefix with "RFC" like so: {RFC#282} or {RFC252}.</li>
<li>If you include the word "meeting" in the line item, the time will also count as a meeting!</li>
</ul>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre>- worked on a ticket [1 hour] {27762}
- change management meeting, lots of fun [20 mins]
- did something that required no time!
- finished up a project {RFC#200}
- weekly meeting lasted forever [2h15m]</pre>

<h2>Notes Format</h2>

<p>Your notes can be in any format you want; they're not parsed, only stored for later reference.</p>
